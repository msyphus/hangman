# Cat Trap

### Demo
The game can be played [here.](https://msyphus.github.io/hangman/)

### General
A cat-themed word guessing game.  Guess the word before Huhu, the cat, bites your hand for rubbing his belly too much! 

The player is allowed five incorrect guesses, each guess is considered a belly rub.  Simply type letters (only letters are allowed) using your keyboard. Letters are not case sensitive.  Choosing the same letter more than once **is** allowed, so be careful!  Letters that have been guessed are displayed below the hidden word blanks.

There is a dashboard displaying how many belly rubs (incorrect guesses) the player has remaining and how many times the player has won or lost.  An image and accompanying caption change based on the number of belly rubs that are remaining.

The New Game button will generate a new hidden word.  All words are cat-related.
